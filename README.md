# ccextractor-org-media
Contains all graphic media related to CCExtractor.
- `static` folder holds the images themselves which can be directly used.
- `src` contains the source files for all the images in .ai Illustrator format.
- `ext` contains all the extra, external media to be served directly for various purposes (READMEs, blogs, etc.).
- `3D logos` contains files for the 3D version of the organization logo.

## Usage
- If you're going to use the logo as it is, it would be a good idea to use the images from the `static` folder. <br>
- If you will be scaling the logo, use the provided vector to avoid losing sharpness in your project.

## Resources
The `resources` folder contains some of the design components used.
- `color-swatches` contains the color swatch used in Photoshop and Illustrator format.
- `pixel_perfect_typeface` is the typeface used in .ai format (to avoid quality loss it hasn't been made into a font file).

## Concept
The aim was to come up with something that captured everything the organization stood for and did. The pre-existing CC logo which represented Closed Captions was a bit restricting. <br>
The current logo solves that by visualizing CCExtractor in the design, we see the video going in and the subtitles file coming out.
